Guess The Word Game 🎮
An interactive word guessing game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The program selects a random word, and the player must guess it within a limited number of tries.
Each entered letter is color-coded to show if it’s correct and in the right place, correct but in the wrong place, or completely wrong.
You can use the "Hints" button for limited help during the game.
